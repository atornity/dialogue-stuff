dialogue-stuff

you can write things like "i'm[delay:0.5] tired" to display "i'm tired" but with a delay in the middle. so it's like "i'm ... tired" but without the dots. so it becomes like this "i'm tired". basically like that but with, like a delay before "tired". you know, like.
"i'm



tired" 
like this a little bit but it's still next to eachother so like "i'm tired" but with like a delay and stuff
